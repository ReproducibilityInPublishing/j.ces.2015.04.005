# Computational Effort

Several scripts have been created to manage the computational aspects of this article. None of these scripts require particularly intense computing power or speed. Nevertheless, The machine we used to measure these times was: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6900K CPU @ 3.20GHz

## Computational Experiments

These scripts produce data to be analyzed for figures or produce figues and tables themselves directly.

* `Tables2and3andFigure1.py` < 5min @ 1 core
* `RunCases.sh` < 30 min @ 1 core
* `Figures12and13.py` < 1 min @ 1 core
* `Figure14.py` < 1 min @ 1 core

## Visualizations

These scripts produce Figures from the article.

* `Create_Inversion_Plots.sh` < 5 min @ 1 core
* `Create_Comparison_Plots.sh` < 5 min @ 1 core
